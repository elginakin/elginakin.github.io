# Abstract 
An increase in the number of human cases of influenza A/H5N1 infection in the US has raised 
concerns about the pandemic potential of the virus. Preexisting population immunity is a key 
determinant for risk assessment and pandemic potential for any virus. Antibody responses against the 
bovine A/H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins were measured among a 
population of influenza-vaccinated or influenza-infected individuals. Modest titers of bovine A/H5N1 
HA-binding antibodies and low to undetectable neutralizing antibody responses were detected in a 
cohort of 73 individuals. Conversely, bovine A/H5N1 NA binding and neuraminidase-inhibiting 
antibody responses were comparable to those against a human A/H1N1 NA at baseline. Seasonal 
influenza vaccination failed to significantly increase antibody titers against both HA and NA 
glycoproteins of bovine A/H5N1. Recent infection with human A/H1N1 but not A/H3N2 viruses 
induced significant increases in bovine A/H5N1 neutralizing antibody, as well as increases in NA-
binding and NA-inhibiting antibodies to bovine A/H5N1 NA. While the degree of protection afforded by 
these A/H5N1 cross-reactive antibodies is not known, incorporating NA or enhancing current 
seasonal vaccine formulations to increase NA-specific antibody responses may increase antibody 
breadth and protection against both seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.
