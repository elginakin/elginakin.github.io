I am a molecular virologist in the [Pekosz Lab](https://www.pekoszlab.com) at JHSPH. I work within the [Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response](https://www.ceirr-network.org/), with the [Mostafa Lab](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/heba-mostafa) at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine as well as other collaborators. 

My interests include:

* Genomic surveillance of influenza viruses.

* The phenotypic consequences of Influenza B non-structural protein evolution. 

* Bioinformatic tool development for assessing influenza genomic evolution.

* The development of primary cell line models to interrogate viral determinants of host disease.
