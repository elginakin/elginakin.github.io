Static trees require the analyst to provide concise information in a way that is simple to interpret. The beauty of ggtree and its spporting packages is that syntax is simple and intuitive making it easy to add information to your tree. Futhermore, its documentation is incrediblely detailed with abundance reproducible examples and explanations for nearly any attribute you would like to add.\nBelow, I show just one example which best fits only 2 dimensions of information here using tip color and size. However, aesthetics for tip shape as well as for branches can be added as well. It is important that we remember that the tree we have constructed is a down sampled version of our original dataset. Thus, I have included a basic example of a streamgraph from the entire dataset of over 10,000 sequences since we are able to better summarize these data with this visualization."

    "text": "Abstract\nSARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with severe COVID-19 and adverse fetal outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Moreover, clinical studies assessing therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are limited. To address these gaps, we developed a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Outbred CD1 mice were infected at E6, E10, or E16 with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (maSCV2) virus. Outcomes were gestational age‚Äìdependent, with greater morbidity, reduced antiviral immunity, greater viral titers, and impaired fetal growth and neurodevelopment occurring with infection at E16 (third trimester equivalent) than with infection at either E6 (first trimester equivalent) or E10 (second trimester equivalent). To assess the efficacy of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, which is recommended for individuals who are pregnant with COVID-19, we treated E16-infected dams with mouse-equivalent doses of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Treatment reduced pulmonary viral titers, decreased maternal morbidity, and prevented offspring growth restriction and neurodevelopmental impairments. Our results highlight that severe COVID-19 during pregnancy and fetal growth restriction is associated with heightened virus replication in maternal lungs. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir mitigated maternal morbidity along with fetal growth and neurodevelopment restriction after SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings prompt the need for further consideration of pregnancy in preclinical and clinical studies of therapeutics against viral infections.\n\nSupplemental Material\nhttps://doi.org/10.1172/JCI170687DS1"

Until 2020, two genetic lineages of influenza B virus‚ÄîYamagata and Victoria‚Äîcirculated in the population. These lineages are antigenically distinct, but the differences in virus replication or the induction of host cell responses after infection have not been carefully studied. Recent IBV clinical isolates of both lineages were obtained from influenza surveillance efforts of the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Response and characterized in vitro. B/Victoria and B/Yamagata clinical isolates were recognized less efficiently by serum from influenza-vaccinated individuals in comparison to the vaccine strains. B/Victoria lineages formed smaller plaques on MDCK cells compared to B/Yamagata, but infectious virus production in primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures showed no differences. While ciliated epithelial cells were the dominant cell type infected by both lineages, B/Victoria lineages had a slight preference for MUC5AC-positive cells, and B/Yamagata lineages infected more basal cells. Finally, while both lineages induced a strong interferon response 48 h after infection of hNEC cultures, the B/Victoria lineages showed a much stronger induction of interferon-related signaling pathways compared to B/Yamagata. This demonstrates that the two influenza B virus lineages differ not only in their antigenic structure but also in their ability to induce host innate immune responses.\n\nSupplemental Material\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v15091956/s1"

Rothman, Lynda Coughlan, Andrew Pekosz\nPreprint Link : biorxiv\nPreprint PDF : Influenza_B_Virus_Lineages.pdf\n\nAbstract\nAn increase in the number of human cases of influenza A/H5N1 infection in the US has raised concerns about the pandemic potential of the virus. Preexisting population immunity is a key determinant for risk assessment and pandemic potential for any virus. Antibody responses against the bovine A/H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins were measured among a population of influenza-vaccinated or influenza-infected individuals. Modest titers of bovine A/H5N1 HA-binding antibodies and low to undetectable neutralizing antibody responses were detected in a cohort of 73 individuals. Conversely, bovine A/H5N1 NA binding and neuraminidase-inhibiting antibody responses were comparable to those against a human A/H1N1 NA at baseline. Seasonal influenza vaccination failed to significantly increase antibody titers against both HA and NA glycoproteins of bovine A/H5N1. Recent infection with human A/H1N1 but not A/H3N2 viruses induced significant increases in bovine A/H5N1 neutralizing antibody, as well as increases in NA- binding and NA-inhibiting antibodies to bovine A/H5N1 NA. While the degree of protection afforded by these A/H5N1 cross-reactive antibodies is not known, incorporating NA or enhancing current seasonal vaccine formulations to increase NA-specific antibody responses may increase antibody breadth and protection against both seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses."
