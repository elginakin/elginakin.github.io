The beauty of ggtree and its spporting packages is that syntax is simple and intuitive making it easy to add information to your tree. Futhermore, its documentation is incrediblely detailed with abundance reproducible examples and explanations for nearly any attribute you would like to add.\nBelow, I show just one example which best fits only 2 dimensions of information here using tip color and size. However, aesthetics for tip shape as well as for branches can be added as well. It is important that we remember that the tree we have constructed is a down sampled version of our original dataset. Thus, I have included a basic example of a streamgraph from the entire dataset of over 10,000 sequences since we are able to better summarize these data with this visualization."

We will use the metadata_join dataframe we generated containing nextclade-assigned clades. Again, we face the issue of attempting to visualize 23 clades on one plot. However, the fact that only one or two clades are dominating at any given time will assist with the constraints of many categorical variables. Since we do not have the luxury of discrete clustering as we did with the tree, we can add lines to separate the clades.\n\nknitr::kable(metadata_join %&gt;% \n  select(strain, date, `short-clade`) %&gt;% head(15))\n\n\n\n\nstrain\ndate\nshort-clade\n\n\n\n\nMT056202\n2020-01-02\n3C.3a1\n\n\nMT105434\n2020-01-02\n3C.2a1b.2b\n\n\nMT105458\n2020-01-03\n3C.2a1b.2\n\n\nMT168634\n2020-01-06\n3C.3a1\n\n\nMT168693\n2020-01-01\n3C.2a1b.2\n\n\nMT168702\n2020-01-01\n3C.2a1b.2\n\n\nMT168789\n2020-01-02\n3C.2a1b.2b\n\n\nMT169082\n2020-01-07\n3C.2a1b.2a\n\n\nMT169091\n2020-01-07\n3C.2a1b.2a\n\n\nMT169171\n2020-01-05\n3C.2a1b.1a\n\n\nMT169188\n2020-01-03\n3C.2a1b.1a\n\n\nMT169196\n2020-01-08\n3C.2a1b.1b\n\n\nMT169204\n2020-01-12\n3C.2a1b.1b\n\n\nMT169212\n2020-01-12\n3C.2a1b.1b\n\n\nMT169276\n2020-01-02\n3C.2a1b.2b"

Moreover, clinical studies assessing therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy are limited. To address these gaps, we developed a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Outbred CD1 mice were infected at E6, E10, or E16 with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (maSCV2) virus. Outcomes were gestational age–dependent, with greater morbidity, reduced antiviral immunity, greater viral titers, and impaired fetal growth and neurodevelopment occurring with infection at E16 (third trimester equivalent) than with infection at either E6 (first trimester equivalent) or E10 (second trimester equivalent). To assess the efficacy of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, which is recommended for individuals who are pregnant with COVID-19, we treated E16-infected dams with mouse-equivalent doses of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Treatment reduced pulmonary viral titers, decreased maternal morbidity, and prevented offspring growth restriction and neurodevelopmental impairments. Our results highlight that severe COVID-19 during pregnancy and fetal growth restriction is associated with heightened virus replication in maternal lungs. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir mitigated maternal morbidity along with fetal growth and neurodevelopment restriction after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Until 2020, two genetic lineages of influenza B virus—Yamagata and Victoria—circulated in the population. These lineages are antigenically distinct, but the differences in virus replication or the induction of host cell responses after infection have not been carefully studied. Recent IBV clinical isolates of both lineages were obtained from influenza surveillance efforts of the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Influenza Research and Response and characterized in vitro. B/Victoria and B/Yamagata clinical isolates were recognized less efficiently by serum from influenza-vaccinated individuals in comparison to the vaccine strains. B/Victoria lineages formed smaller plaques on MDCK cells compared to B/Yamagata, but infectious virus production in primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures showed no differences. While ciliated epithelial cells were the dominant cell type infected by both lineages, B/Victoria lineages had a slight preference for MUC5AC-positive cells, and B/Yamagata lineages infected more basal cells. Finally, while both lineages induced a strong interferon response 48 h after infection of hNEC cultures, the B/Victoria lineages showed a much stronger induction of interferon-related signaling pathways compared to B/Yamagata. This demonstrates that the two influenza B virus lineages differ not only in their antigenic structure but also in their ability to induce host innate immune responses.\n\nSupplemental Material\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v15091956/s1"

Rothman, Lynda Coughlan, Andrew Pekosz\nPreprint Link : biorxiv\nPreprint PDF : Influenza_B_Virus_Lineages.pdf\n\nAbstract\nAn increase in the number of human cases of influenza A/H5N1 infection in the US has raised concerns about the pandemic potential of the virus. Preexisting population immunity is a key determinant for risk assessment and pandemic potential for any virus. Antibody responses against the bovine A/H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins were measured among a population of influenza-vaccinated or influenza-infected individuals. Modest titers of bovine A/H5N1 HA-binding antibodies and low to undetectable neutralizing antibody responses were detected in a cohort of 73 individuals. Conversely, bovine A/H5N1 NA binding and neuraminidase-inhibiting antibody responses were comparable to those against a human A/H1N1 NA at baseline. Seasonal influenza vaccination failed to significantly increase antibody titers against both HA and NA glycoproteins of bovine A/H5N1. Recent infection with human A/H1N1 but not A/H3N2 viruses induced significant increases in bovine A/H5N1 neutralizing antibody, as well as increases in NA- binding and NA-inhibiting antibodies to bovine A/H5N1 NA. While the degree of protection afforded by these A/H5N1 cross-reactive antibodies is not known, incorporating NA or enhancing current seasonal vaccine formulations to increase NA-specific antibody responses may increase antibody breadth and protection against both seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses."

The IBV responsible for the surge, C.3re, was a clade C.3 virus that had reassorted with clade C.5.1 viruses and acquired a mutation predicted to mask a key neutralizing antibody epitope on the hemagglutinin protein. The neuramindase gene contained mutations predicted to reduce neutralizing antibody binding and potentially alter oseltamivir sensitivity. The C.3re viruses preferentially infected children but showed no significant increase in disease severity. The C.3re viruses were poorly neutralized by pre and post influenza vaccination serum."

    "text": "CONCLUSIONS\nThe C.3re IBV genotype that emerged in late in the 2024-25 influenza season is antigenically mismatched with current circulating IBVs and the IBV vaccine strains chosen for the 2025 Southern Hemisphere and 2024-25 Northern Hemisphere season. This may result in lower vaccine efficacy increases in IBV cases in upcoming influenza seasons."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nSeasonal influenza viruses continually acquire mutations that can alter both their replication efficiency and antigenic properties. While recent seasonal Influenza B viruses (IBV) are characterized as a single clade, V1A.3a.2, defined by mutations in the hemagglutinin or HA protein, they have diversified globally into different subclades showing geographic restrictions. When the C.5 clade first emerged, it showed faster replication kinetics in human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures compared to clade A and C viruses from 2019-2021. The subsequent emergence of the C.5.1 subclade, predominantly observed in North and South America, resulted in no significant antigenic drift when compared to the 2023–2024 Northern Hemisphere vaccine strain, B/Austria/1359417/2021, using a vaccinated human serum set despite a number of mutations fixing in the HA protein. However, the C.5.1 subclade separated into several additional genotypes, some of which exhibit prolonged infectious virus production compared to the ancestral C.5 clade in hNEC cultures. C.5.1 viruses do not exhibit altered cell tropism hNEC cultures, indicating that differences in replication kinetics alone likely account for the observed increase in infectious virus production. The results demonstrate that IBV evolution can lead to changes in infectious virus production in the absence of antigenic drift."
